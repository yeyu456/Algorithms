 * LeetCode 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes
 *
 *  Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.
 *
 *  Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
 *  In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last,
 *  is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.
 *  It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
